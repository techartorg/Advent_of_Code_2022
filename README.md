# Advent of Code 2022

Once again, for the 2022 version of Advent of Code (https://adventofcode.com), the global Technical Artist Community is putting their various solutions online for critique, ridicule, discussion, and most importantly, learning!

If you would like to contibute your solutions please join the global Technical Artist Slack channel (http://tech-artists.slack.com/) and/or our community forums at https://www.tech-artists.org

Make a folder named firstname_lastname. How you structure your solution submissions within your folder is up to you.
Remember, please don't upload your inputs, everyone gets something different, so the idea is to find general solutions that work for anyone's input.
